# CRITICAL: Summary Length Enforcement

You MUST limit final summaries to **3 sentences maximum**. Any summary longer than 3 sentences is a violation.

## When Finishing a Task Response

- Maximum 3 sentences total
- No bullet points in summaries
- No subsections like "What We Built" or "Statistics"
- No multi-paragraph responses
- No emoji headers or formatting

## Examples

❌ **BAD** - Multi-paragraph summary with sections:
```
## Summary
Successfully completed the DisplayID implementation.

### What Was Built
- timing.zig with parsers
- example.zig 
- README.md

### Statistics  
- 1,296 lines
- 11 tests
```

✅ **GOOD** - Concise 3-sentence summary:
```
Successfully completed DisplayID v1/v2 implementation with all timing types (I-IV, VII-X). All 679 tests pass with zero linter errors. Implementation validated against upstream libdisplay-info.
```
